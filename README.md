## Introduction

In this project we are going to do a simple implementation of the game "Rock Paper Scissors" (aka **Schere, Stein, Papier** in German). Some of you who might not know the game can check the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) or this hilarious [Wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors). The game will be played in the command line interface.

## Before Starting

1. Set up the project location using PyCharm where you will be doing the project. 
2. Test by using `print('Hello, World!')` (you know, for good luck ðŸ˜Š).
3. Commit and push your changes to the repository of your project.

## Week 1

Since in the first week we only learn to set up the development environment and did the Hello World exercise, we are going to implement the introduction message when we start the project program. It can be something as simple as 
```
Welcome to the game of Rock Paper Scissors.
```
or it can be as epic as
```
The year is 20xx. The world is overrun by rogue AIs. You are now face to face with the hive mind of all the AIs, the RPS. The world hangs in balance on the game of Rock Paper Scissors that you are going to play against RPS.
```
It is up to you how you want to introduce to the player that runs your project.

Code snippet:
```python
print('Welcome to the game of Rock Paper Scissors.')
```
