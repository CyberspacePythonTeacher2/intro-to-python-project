## Introduction

In this project we are going to do a simple implementation of the game "Rock Paper Scissors" (aka **Schere, Stein, Papier** in German). Some of you who might not know the game can check the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) or this hilarious [Wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors). The game will be played in the command line interface.

## Before Starting

1. Set up the project location using PyCharm where you will be doing the project. 
2. Test by using `print('Hello, World!')` (you know, for good luck ðŸ˜Š).
3. Commit and push your changes to the repository of your project.
